# RiverPod Learning Project

Welcome to my **RiverPod Learning Project**! This repository is where I document my journey of learning [RiverPod](https://riverpod.dev/), a powerful state management solution for Flutter apps.

## Why RiverPod?

- **Simple**: Easy to learn and integrate.
- **Predictable**: Makes state management more predictable and easier to debug.
- **Scalable**: Scales well with large applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

### Setup Instructions

## Features Covered

Here are some of the key features and concepts Iâ€™ve explored so far:

- **Provider Basics**: Creating and consuming providers.
